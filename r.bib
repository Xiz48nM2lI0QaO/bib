abstract = {Abstract The philosophy of measurement studies the conceptual, ontological, epistemic, and technological conditions that make measurement possible and reliable. A new wave of philosophical scholarship has emerged in the last decade that emphasizes the material and historical dimensions of measurement and the relationships between measurement and theoretical modeling. This essay surveys these developments and contrasts them with earlier work on the semantics of quantity terms and the representational character of measurement. The conclusions highlight four characteristics of the emerging research program in philosophy of measurement: it is epistemological, coherentist, practice oriented, and model based.},

abstract = {The world we live in is extraordinarily dynamic and forces us daily to face numerous changes in all areas of life. Although the relationship between private and state property was considered and compared by classics in economics, it is only over the last couple of decades that the privatization processes have become a part of everyday economic life. Privatization reaches all industrial branches and the most recent trend is to involve private sector into public administration. Education system is not immune to privatization either, however, due to its specifi c nature the privatization processes have to be handled very cautiously. This paper examines the meaning of privatization in education, the factors causing privatization in higher education and how it is implemented. It also looks at the issue of advantages and disadvantages of privatization in education, i.e., higher education.},

abstract = {This chapter focuses on the philosophy of technology. Any systematic philosophical discussion of the normativity of technology should be based on a plausible account of the very idea of . Explaining and defending the claim that technologies are inherently normative requires, first, a plausible account of the notions of  and  is essential. The distinct elements of this characterization of technologies can be described as a system. A system is any aggregate (or collective) of mutually interacting material entities within a certain region of space and time. Thus, a system possesses not only a spatial but also a temporal dimension, which allows to see processes as systems. Although the notion of a system may also be used in more substantial ways, this unassuming definition is appropriate in the present context. It may also be phrased by saying that technologies have a systemic character, because they result from bringing, and keeping, together two or more material entities.}
